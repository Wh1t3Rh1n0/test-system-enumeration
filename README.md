# Test-System-Enumeration.bat

A ***really*** simple batch script to automate some initial information gathering during overt, assumed-compromise tests.

A couple functions have been moved to separate Batch files, due to being time-consuming or otherwise annoying.
- `Gather User and Group Comments.bat` - Very slow.
- `Non-PowerShell cpassword Search.bat` - Widely flagged as malicious.
